![Tuna And Cabbage Stir Fry](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2e8c3c57-5348-438a-ac3d-e03418a34c4a.jpg)

This would be one of my "fast-foods" because it is so easy to make, it's healthy and it is heart-warming! If you are on a tight budget yet still want to eat healthy, then worry not, because you can easily afford these ingredients! 

Ingredients: 

1 head of organic cabbage (sliced in long slim strips)

3 -3 ounce cans of tuna (make sure it's pole-caught/and wild)

4 Organic Medium Roma Tomatoes (sliced in quarters)

1 Tbsp Olive Oil

1 Medium Organic Onion (diced)

5 cloves of garlic, peeled, crushed and minced

seasonings I use: black pepper/paprika/himalayan salt 

Cooking Instructions:

1. Prepare the veggies first and set aside. 
2. Heat up large stir fry pan with the olive oil and once it's hot, drop the minced garlic until slightly golden, add the onions, and the tomatoes, stir everything and wait till the tomato skin is loose and it is soft. 
3. Add the cabbage, and add 1 cup of water. Cover it for 5-8mins until cabbage is softer and volume has decreased.
4. Add the 3 cans of tuna in the mix and continue to mix in with the cabbage. Sprinkle with black pepper/ paprika and himalayan salt until desired taste. I do not usually add too much salt (health reasons). Sometimes you can add some sesame seeds to it and a tsp of sesame oil to make it taste like an asian dish!
5. With this kind of base you can always change the meat that you add to it. Example: sliced chicken breast with the cabbage/ or turkey meat/ or sausage/ or shrimp, etc. 
6. Serve over jasmine rice or as is! Enjoy!
